hello world Cryptography represents an important part of the information exchange nowadays providing secure communications and data integrity. There are many existing encryption algorithms that could provide the confidentiality and integrity data during transmission over different channels One of the most used cryptographic algorithms is AES Advanced Encryption Standard It was developed in 2001 by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemon, as a replacement for DES. that became outdated and insecure 
There was a sequential encryption implemented on Intel Core i7-4790 CPU and a parallel one on the GPU of NVIDIA Tesla K40 consisting of 2880 cores (15 Multiprocessors, 192 cores each). The results showed that the speedup is increasing as the data size increases, achieving an execution time of 61.36x smaller on GPU than on CPU for 256 KB. Implementing parallelism for the SIMD architecture of the multiprocessors in the GPU proved to achieve a great performance.
