hello world Cryptography represents an important part of the information
 exchange nowadays providing secure communications and data integrity.
There are many existing encryption algorithms that could provide the confidentiality and integrity
data during transmission over different channels One of the most used cryptographic algorithms is AES
Advanced Encryption Standard It was developed in 2001 by Vincent Rijmen
and Joan Daemon, as a replacement for DES. that became outdated and insecure
as technology advanced, mostly because of its short key length. The AES algorithm 
is widely used in wireless security, file encryption, SSL/TLS etc.
AES, also known by its original  name Rijndael, is a symmetric key algorithm,
or secret-key algorithm, meaning that both  the encryption and the decryption are
performed with the same key.  AES  is also a block cipher,
that uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key  to process 128-bit data blocks. 
 AES comes with a key expansion algorithm, so that each encryption step
is performed using different sub-keys. The following figure illustrates the 
process of a 128-bit AES encryption. The data block and the key are represented
as 4x4 matrix,  where each element has 1 byte.  Of course, for key lengths of 192-bit
