hello world Cryptography represents an important part of the information  exchange nowadays providing secure communications and data integrity. There are many existing encryption algorithms that could provide
and integrity data during transmission over different channels One of the most used cryptographic algorithms is AES Advanced Encryption Standard It was developed in 2001 by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemon, as a replacement for DES.
that became outdated and insecure as technology advanced, mostly because of its short key length. The AES algorithm  is widely used in wireless security, file encryption, SSL/TLS etc. AES, also known by
 its original  name Rijndael, is a symmetric key algorithm, or secret-key algorithm, meaning that both  the encryption and the decryption are performed with the same key.  AES  is also a block cipher,
that uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key  to process 128-bit data blocks.  AES comes with a key expansion algorithm, so that each encryption step is performed using different sub-keys. The following figure illustrates the
