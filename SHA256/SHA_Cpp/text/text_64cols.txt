hello world
Cryptography represents an important part 
of the information exchange nowadays
providing secure communications and data integrity.
There are many existing encryption algorithms
that could provide the confidentiality and integrity
data during transmission over different channels
One of the most used cryptographic algorithms is AES
Advanced Encryption Standard
It was developed in 2001 by Vincent Rijmen
and Joan Daemon, as a replacement for DES.
that became outdated and insecure
as technology advanced, mostly because
of its short key length. The AES algorithm 
is widely used in wireless security, file
encryption, SSL/TLS etc.
AES, also known by its original 
name Rijndael, is a symmetric key algorithm,
or secret-key algorithm, meaning that both
 the encryption and the decryption are
performed with the same key. 
AES 
is also a block cipher,
that uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key
 to process 128-bit data blocks. 
 AES comes with a key expansion
algorithm, so that each encryption step
is performed using different sub-keys.
The following figure illustrates the 
process of a 128-bit AES encryption.
 The data
block and the key are represented
as 4x4 matrix,
 where each element has 1 byte. 
 Of
course, 
for key lengths of 192-bit
 or 256-bit the matrix dimension would 
 be 4x6 or 4x8. 
 The output of each step 
 represents an input for the following step.
 The initial key passes
 through a series of
 transformations, in 10 different rounds
 (for AES 128). 
 For AES 192 and AES 256 there
 are 8, respectively 7 rounds.
 The subkey
obtained in every round 
is used in the Add round key 
step from the encryption.
Parallel implementations come with 
a great advantage compared to the conventional
ones: high speedup.
 This is also the case for cryptographic 
 algorithms, that
can provide the same efficiency
 in terms of security, but a lot faster.
 In order to compare further 
 the performance of the
 AES implementation on the
custom accelerator, I compiled
 a list of papers in which different
 methods of parallelization,
