hello world
Cryptography represents an important part 
of the information exchange nowadays
providing secure communications and data integrity.
There are many existing encryption algorithms
that could provide the confidentiality and integrity
data during transmission over different channels
One of the most used cryptographic algorithms is AES
Advanced Encryption Standard
It was developed in 2001 by Vincent Rijmen
and Joan Daemon, as a replacement for DES.
that became outdated and insecure
as technology advanced, mostly because
of its short key length. The AES algorithm 
is widely used in wireless security, file
encryption, SSL/TLS etc.
