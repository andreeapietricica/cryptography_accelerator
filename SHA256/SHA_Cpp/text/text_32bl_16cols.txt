hello world Cryptography represents an important part of the information exchange nowadays providing secure communications and data integrity. There are many existing encryption algorithms that could provide the confidentiality and integrity data during transmission over different channels One of the most used cryptographic algorithms is AES Advanced Encryption Standard It was developed in 2001 by Vincent Rijmen and Joan Daemon, as a replacement for DES. that became outdated and insecure as technology advanced, mostly because of its short key length. The AES algorithm  is widely used in wireless security, file encryption, SSL/TLS etc. AES, also known by its original  name Rijndael, is a symmetric key algorithm, or secret-key algorithm, meaning that both the encryption and the decryption are performed with the same key.  AES  is also a block  cipher, that uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit key  to process 128-bit data blocks.   AES comes with a key expansion algorithm, so that each encryption step is performed using different sub-keys. The following figure illustrates the  process of a 128-bit AES encryption.  The data block and the key are represented as 4x4 matrix,  where each element has 1 byte.   Of course,  for key lengths of 192-bit  or 256-bit the matrix dimension would   be 4x6 or 4x8.   The output of each step   represents an input for the following step.  The initial key passes  through a series of  transformations, in 10 different rounds (for AES 128).   For AES 192 and AES 256 there  are 8, respectively 7 rounds.  The subkey obtained in every round  is used in the Add round key  step from the encryption. Parallel implementations come with  a great advantage compared to the conventional ones: high speedup.  This is also the case for cryptographic   algorithms, that can provide the same efficiency  in terms of security, but a lot faster.  In order to compare further   the performance of the  AES implementation on the custom accelerator,
There was a sequential encryption implemented on Intel Core i7-4790 CPU and a parallel one on the GPU of NVIDIA Tesla K40 consisting of 2880 cores (15 Multiprocessors, 192 cores each). The results showed that the speedup is increasing as the data size increases, achieving an execution time of 61.36x smaller on GPU than on CPU for 256 KB. Implementing parallelism for the SIMD architecture of the multiprocessors in the GPU proved to achieve a great performance. This paper presents a parallel architecture developed using FPGA, by showing a method of achieving maximum utilization of its logic cells and I/O resources. They compare this implementation to the conventional pipeline architectures for symmetric cryptographic algorithms like AES and DES. They use Virtex-II Pro FPGAs for this approach. The proposal is based on the idea that pipelined architectures require a large amount of silicon area for the implementation of the block ciphers. But parallel blocks allow more flexibility when designing an encryption system, because they are smaller than pipelined blocks and offer a greater performance by using a number of n parallel blocks in the same area. Although, the parallel encryption blocks have an area disadvantage with respect to the pipelined architecture because each individual block has its own key, so the hardware is duplicated (see the next picture). But this also increase the security. The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric algorithm that uses a 56-bit key and operates on 64-bit blocks of data. The basic operations of DES include permutations, compressions, expansions, and shifts using 32-bit operands. The proposed architecture includes 17 separate parallel DES or 3DES blocks. Some functions are just once implemented, so the same hardware is reused 16 times, leading to a smaller area and a high-throughput. The throughput is calculated as the average of total plain text, in a number of bytes, divided by the average encryption time.
